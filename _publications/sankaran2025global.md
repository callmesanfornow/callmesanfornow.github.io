Code switching, particularly between Korean and English, has become a defining feature of modern K-pop, reflecting both aesthetic choices and global market strategies. This paper is a primary investigation into the linguistic strategies employed in K-pop songs that achieve global chart success, with a focus on the role of code-switching and English lyric usage. A dataset of K-pop songs that appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 and Global 200 charts from 2017 to 2025, spanning 14 groups and 8 solo artists, was compiled. Using this dataset, the proportion of English and Korean lyrics, the frequency of code-switching, and other stylistic features were analysed. It was found that English dominates the linguistic landscape of globally charting K-pop songs, with both male and female performers exhibiting high degrees of code-switching and English usage. Statistical tests indicated no significant gender-based differences, although female solo artists tend to favour English more consistently. A classification task was also performed to predict performer gender from lyrics, achieving macro F1 scores up to 0.76 using multilingual embeddings and handcrafted features. Finally, differences between songs charting on the Hot 100 versus the Global 200 were examined, suggesting that, while there is no significant gender difference in English, higher English usage may be more critical for success in the US-focused Hot 100. The findings highlight how linguistic choices in K-pop lyrics are shaped by global market pressures and reveal stylistic patterns that reflect performer identity and chart context.
