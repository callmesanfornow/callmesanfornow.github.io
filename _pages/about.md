Hi! I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the Data Intelligence and Communication Engineering Lab of Télécom SudParis, Institut Polytechnique de Paris, where I am supervised by [Noel Crespi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z_-5wSkAAAAJ) and [Reza Farahbakhsh](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=HukBnBlWTE0C&). I am a recipient of a fellowship under the Indo-French Center for the Promotion of Advanced Research[CEFIPRA/IFCPAR] for the [ADEPT](https://ifindia.cdn.betanet.in/ifindia/uploads/2024/03/PhD-in-AI-Computer-Science.pdf) project.

My research focuses on the intersection of Speech and Language Technologies and Computational Social Sciences, with an emphasis on hate and offensive content moderation, particularly in low-resource and code-mixed/code-switched languages. I also work in the computational aspects of Digital Humanities, focusing on literary devices, code-switching and its impact on the popularity of new media.
